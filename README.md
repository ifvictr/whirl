## Deploy

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Setup

Whirl comprises of four components:

1. The web server for receiving and responding to event payloads from Slack
2. A **MongoDB database** to save chat metadata (e.g., start time, message count, participants, etc.) after a chat has ended
3. A **Redis cache** for storing references to the users who should receive messages from a chat while it is ongoing
4. The Slack app itself

### Environment variables

Here are all the variables you need to set up on the server, with hints.

```bash
# Port to run the server on
PORT=3000

DATABASE_URL=mongodb://â€¦
REDIS_URL=redis://â€¦

# App config. Obtained from the "Basic Information" page of your app.
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-â€¦
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=xxxxâ€¦

# A chat must have at least this many messages for its metadata to be saved.
CHAT_METADATA_THRESHOLD=3
```

### Starting the server

_This section is only relevent to you if youâ€™ve decided to run Whirl on a platform other than Heroku._

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ifvictr/whirl
cd whirl

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start Whirl in production! This will build the source files and then run them.
yarn start
# Or, if you need to run it in development mode instead.
yarn dev
```

### Creating the Slack app

For Whirl to work, youâ€™ll need to [register a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps) with the appropriate OAuth permissions, event subscriptions, and commands.

#### Basic Information

Save the **Signing Secret** (not Client Secret) for the `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` environment variable.

#### App Home

For Whirl to work, youâ€™ll need to enable both the **Home** and **Messages** tabs of the app.

#### Interactivity & Shortcuts

For the **Request URL** under the **Interactivity** section, enter `http://<YOUR DOMAIN HERE>/slack/events`. This will be used for the appâ€™s buttons.

#### Slash Commands

The following commands are needed. Enter the same request URL you used in the previous section.

- `/end`: Ends the current chat
- `/next`: Go to the next chat

#### OAuth & Permissions

Install the Slack app to your desired Slack workspace first. Youâ€™ll get a **Bot User OAuth Access Token** which will be used for the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable.

The following bot token scopes are required:

- `chat:write`: Used for sending messages.
- `chat:write.customize`: Used for sending messages to the receiving side of a chat with the senderâ€™s pseudonym.
- `commands`: Used for `/end` and `/next`.
- `im:history`: Used for reading the messages a user sends in a DM with Whirl. If theyâ€™re in a chat, Whirl will send it to the other users with a pseudonym.
- `reactions:read`: Used for notifying users that reactions arenâ€™t currently supported ðŸ˜ž
- `reactions:write`: Used for chat read receipts.

#### Event Subscriptions

Subscribe to the following bot events:

- `app_home_opened`
- `message.im`
- `reaction_added`

The request URL is also the same here.

After youâ€™ve followed all the above steps, you should see something like this in the console:

```bash
Starting Whirlâ€¦
Listening on port 3000
```
